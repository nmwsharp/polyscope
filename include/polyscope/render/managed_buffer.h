/*
 * This class is a wrapper which sits on top of data buffers in Polyscope, and handles common data-management concerns
 * of:
 *
 *      (a) mirroring the buffer to the GPU/rendering framework
 *      (b) allowing external users to update data either on the CPU- or GPU-side, and updating mirrored copies
 * appropriately
 *      (c) managed _indexed_ data, which gts expanded according to some index set for access at rendering time.
 *
 * Most often this class is used to wrap structure/quantity data passed in by the user, such as a scalar quantity, but
 * it is also sometimes wraps automatically-computed values within Polyscope, such as a vertex normal buffer for
 * rendering.
 *
 * This class offers functions and accessors which can (and generally, MUST) be used to interact with the underlying
 * data buffer.

  // When `dataGetsComputed = true`, we are in Case B, and computeFunc() must be set to a callback that does the
  // lazy computing.

  // == Basic interactions

  // Ensure that the `data` member vector reference is populated with the current values. In the common-case where
  // the user sets data and it never changes, then this function will do nothing. However, if e.g. the value is
  // being updated directly from GPU memory, this will mirror the updates to the cpu-side vector. Also, if the value
  // is lazily computed by computeFunc(), it ensures that that function has been called.

  // reflecting updates to the render buffer.

  // == Indexed views
  // ========================================================================

  // For some data (e.g. values a vertices of a mesh), we store the data in a canonical ordering (one value per
  // vertex), but need to index it at render time according to some specified list of indices (one value per
  // triangle corner). Rendering frameworks _do_ have explicit support for this case (e.g. IndexedArray DrawMode in
  // openGL), but for various reasons it does not make sense to use those features. Instead, we explicitly expand
  // out the data into a render buffer for drawing as view[i] = data[indices[i]].
  //
  // If such an index is used, it should be set to the `indices` argument below, and this class will automatically
  // handle expanding out the indexed data to populate the returned buffer. External callers can still update the
  // data directly on the host, and this class will handle updating an indexed version of the data for drawing.
  //
  // Internally, these indexed views are cached. It is safe to call this function many times, after the first the
  // same view will be returned repeatedly at no additional cost.

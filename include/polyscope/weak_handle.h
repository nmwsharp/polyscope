// or its subclasses by calling getWeakHandle();
//
// NOTE: this does _not_ necessarily handle the case where the object is in the midst of being destructed. In that case,
// the time at which the handle reports destruction depends on when the WeakReferrable destructor is called.
//
// (This is somewhat bad design from a C++ standpoint, it would be better to avoid the need for this. But there's lots
// of irregular lifetime management in Polyscope and it's often an easier solution. If only there was a weak_ptr<> for
// unique_ptr<>....)
